# callcenter_response_prediction

The models shown in the Jupyter Notebooks of this repository were used for building a Support Vector Machine Classifier and a Random Forest Classifier for predicting if a customer called by a callcenter would pick up a call or not given all previously known parameters.

The model is based on actual data from a telecoms provider in the UK which we collaborated with during a group project in UCL's Business Analytics MSc program.

The ML algorithms achieve reasonably good performance (business impact of 1m+ GBP for the company we worked with) and could be transferred for a methodological machine learning prediction in the future.
